# MechConnect
A platform similar to GitHub made for engineers to share their work. This platform will allow engineers to share projects they have worked on such as CAD Modelling, simulations, analyses, etc... The two co-founders wish to make this platform so that engineers all over can make an even more competitive profile when applying for a career.
